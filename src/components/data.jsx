The work is varied which keeps it interesting, from campus tours to sign in desks and setting up for events, it helped me develop lots of skills which I'm sure I will use in my future career. It's also great that you can fit the work in around your college schedule and make use of hours off in college to earn some extra skills! The work was always good fun because you were with other people.",
