          ENSURING MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION IN APOGEE 2024
        </h2>
        <span>
          The primary task of every Campus Ambassador is to ensure maximum
          participation from their college. The efforts of the Campus Ambassador
          in this direction will be judged by a referral code system, with each
          Campus Ambassadors referral code being his/her name as mentioned
          during registration.
        </span>
        <span>
          Points Allocation for Registration: 100 points per participant.Until
          APOGEE, this will be monitored on the basis of number of registrations
          on the website. However, after APOGEE, the points from this will be
          revised based on the number of students who attended APOGEE.
        </span>
        <span>
          We strongly advise you to ensure that your referral code is advertised
          well, and everyone is requested to mention your name in the referred
          by field in the registration form, otherwise your efforts will not be
          translated into points on the leaderboard.
